# description: "Engineer focused on infrastructure, developer tooling, and open source"
---

Hi, I'm an engineer who enjoys building systems and tools that make complex problems easier to understand and operate. I work at the intersection of **infrastructure, DevOps, and developer tooling**, with a strong focus on open source and community-driven projects.

I maintain and lead projects under **[IOFlux](https://github.com/ioflux-org)**, where I explore ideas around data tooling and JSON Schema. I'm also a **maintainer and Google Summer of Code mentor** with the **[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)** organization.

---

## What I work on

Professionally, I work on **infrastructure** and **DevOps systems** that support real production workloads. My work involves designing and operating **Docker and Kubernetes** based environments, building **CI/CD pipelines**, and managing cloud infrastructure on **AWS and Azure**, primarily using **infrastructure as code**.

I've worked on both building new systems from scratch and improving existing ones, focusing on reliability, security, and repeatability. This includes automating environment provisioning, optimizing build and deployment pipelines, and designing infrastructure that follows **least-privilege** and scalability principles.

Alongside my full-time role, I spend a significant amount of time building and maintaining **open-source tooling**, mainly around **JSON Schema and data**, under the **[IOFlux](https://github.com/ioflux-org)** umbrella.

## How I got here

I was introduced to programming in late high school, but at the time it felt overwhelming. I chose Electrical Engineering instead, thinking software wasn't for me. During my second year of engineering, I gave programming another chance -- and this time it clicked.

While exploring open source and hackathons, I learned about **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** and decided to try contributing seriously. I started contributing to the **JSON Schema** ecosystem, and in 2023, I was selected as a **GSoC mentee** to work on **[Bowtie](https://github.com/bowtie-json-schema/bowtie/)**, a meta-validator that coordinates and compares JSON Schema validator implementations.

That experience became a turning point. After successfully completing GSoC, I continued contributing to projects like **[learnjsonschema.com](https://www.learnjsonschema.com/2020-12)**, and later had the opportunity to serve as a **GSoC mentor** for JSON Schema. Over time, my involvement grew from contributor to maintainer, allowing me to both build tooling and mentor new contributors.

## How I think about engineering

I put more weight on **_why_** before **_how_**.

Before building anything, I try to understand why a problem exists and what value solving it actually provides. If the _why_ is clear, the _how_ becomes more meaningful and often simpler. This approach helps avoid unnecessary complexity and leads to systems that are easier to maintain and evolve.

I prefer systems that are easy to understand and build on, with clear trade-offs, rather than clever but hard-to-maintain solutions -- especially in infrastructure and tooling.

## Projects & open-source work

Some projects and contributions I’ve been closely involved with:

- **JSON Schema (Maintainer, GSoC Mentor)**  
  Contributor to the JSON Schema ecosystem, including mentoring GSoC contributors and working on tooling, documentation, and community initiatives.

- **Bowtie (GSoC 2023)**  
  A meta-validator for JSON Schema that compares validator implementations for specification compliance.  
  I built a modern React-based UI for visualizing validation reports and improved usability, added features such as local report uploads and implementation-specific views. _[learn more](https://gist.github.com/AgniveshChaubey/3935e130d65ebe02cc60fd95c8273091)_

- **learnjsonschema.com**  
  Worked on improving reference documentation by writing clear, accurate validation and annotation examples for the JSON Schema 2020-12 vocabulary. _[learn more](https://github.com/sourcemeta/learnjsonschema.com)_

- **Studio JSON Schema**  
  A visualization tool that represents JSON Schemas as interactive graphs, making complex schemas easier to explore and debug. _[learn more](https://github.com/ioflux-org/studio-json-schema)_

- **Transform JSON Schema (in progress)**  
  A library for practical, JSON Schema-driven transformations, including applying defaults, removing unknown properties, and converting query strings into correctly typed JSON documents. _[learn more](https://github.com/AgniveshChaubey/data-transformation)_

I’ve also represented the JSON Schema organization at the **[APIDays India](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/agniveshchaubey_just-back-from-apidays-india-and-it-was-activity-7383138521794043904-rAEs)** conference, engaging with community members on JSON Schema, its relationship to OpenAPI and AsyncAPI, and open-source collaboration.

## Beyond the code

Open source has played a major role in how I learn and grow as an engineer. I enjoy collaborating in public, reviewing and discussing design decisions, and helping others navigate complex technical topics.

Mentoring and community work have become an important part of my journey, and I value environments where learning, ownership, and knowledge-sharing are encouraged.
